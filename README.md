Manage My Keys
===========

Manage My Keys (MMK) is an application which allows users to manage an application-specific key (which is a password/passphrase) for a variety of services. At the present time, MMK is integrated with the WPA Wireless (AirBears2) system, and Google Apps for the berkeley.edu domain (bConnected).
